# Travel-Guide-AI
In this project, I created a basic travel guide app using Computer Vision (YOLOv8) and a LLM (Llama3.1 70b) from "Groq" and for the UI I used "streamlit".
I labelled and trained images about 2 certain places "Galata" and "Eiffel" tower images with using roboflow. (I just used 100 Eiffel and 80 Galata images)
You can use my "best.pt" file or you can train and use new one.
